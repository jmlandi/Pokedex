### ðŸ’­ About
If a wild Pokemon appears when you are walking in the tall grass, this website will help you! On this project, I created a Pokedex with the Black and White pokemons that you can insert the pokemon name or ID and the website returns the basic information about him (sprite, name and Id). The website was made with `HTML, CSS and JS` fetching the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to improve my knowledge about JS and `RESTful APIs`.
### ðŸ¤ž Hope you liked it!
